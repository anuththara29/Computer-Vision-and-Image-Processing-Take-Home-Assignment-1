# EC7212 ‚Äì Computer Vision and Image Processing 

## Take Home Assignment 1 
This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental image processing operations using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**, created as part of the EC7212 ‚Äì Computer Vision and Image Processing coursework.

### üìÑ Assignment Description
Write Python programs to perform the following image processing operations:
1. **Intensity Level Reduction**  
   Reduce the number of intensity levels in an image from 256 to 2, in integer powers of 2.  
   The desired number of intensity levels needs to be a variable input to your program.

2. **Spatial Averaging (Smoothing)**  
   Load an image and then perform a simple spatial average (mean filter) over a:
   - 3√ó3 neighborhood  
   - 10√ó10 neighborhood  
   - 20√ó20 neighborhood  

3. **Image Rotation**  
   Rotate an image by:
   - 45 degrees  
   - 90 degrees

4. **Block Averaging (Simulated Resolution Reduction)**  
   For every non-overlapping block of the image, replace all the corresponding pixels with their average:
   - 3√ó3 block (9 pixels)  
   - 5√ó5 block  
   - 7√ó7 block
